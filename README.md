### The Alunmi website is primarily aimed at current and former students of Central and North Metropolitan TAFE, to enable them to connect and remain in contact with lecturers and other students (current and former). The website will enable members to keep track of where former students are and what they are doing in industry, and provide a facility for those students to share their experiences.
